      <h4> IBM </h4>
      At IBM, I am a full stack AI and Analytics consultant. There, I work with clients to to drive insights through data science and ensure that their data can be accessed throughout their enterprise. Most recently, my team designed a data architecture solution for a multibillion dollar company. In the past, I worked in-house to test and develop forecasting and data harmonization software for clients.
      <br><br>
      <h4> The University of Chicago </h4>
      When I first enrolled in UChicago, my goal was to study physics, attend graduate school, and eventually be a professor and perform research. Finding patterns from data and to then understand a larger picture through math was exciting, and I was excited to pursue this field in such a rigorous environment. During my time at UChicago, I challenged myself while helping others grow. I graduated in July 2021 with a BA in Physics with honors and a BS in Mathematics; my favorite classes included Graduate Quantum Mechanics and Graduate Relativity; I became the President of the Society of Physics Students, where I ran several fundraisers to promote STEM education.
      <br><br>
      I was fortunate enough to be able to intern at Fermilab, a national physics laboratory, throughout college. When I was a third-year, I worked in their theoretical physics department. For my main project, I worked alongside theoretical physicists, nuclear physicists, and neutrino physicists to develop software that could simulate the interactions between  particles in any environment. More specifically, I developed software that simulated the interactions between known neutrinos and theoretical neutrinos using Monte Carlo simulations.
      <br><br>
      While at Fermilab, I found that my true passion lay in coding and running situations. It was during this period that I taught myself how to implement neural networks for forecasting, NLP, and image recognition. I also took classes, such as Introduction to Random Matrices, to pursue this interest. After several side projects, I decided to pursue data science full time after college.

          I was a TA for Calculus during my 4 years at UChicago, where I worked with students during office hours and graded assignments. Topics that I have taught include trigonometry, precalculus, calculus I-IV, linear algebra, differential equations, and mechanics. I have found success with my students by assigning them homework, creating problems that address their weaknesses, and reinforcing topics they are comfortable with.
